RCS (Relative Convergence Speed)
==================================================================================================

In [1] we proposed Relative Convergence Speed (RCS) as measure for the convergence speed that takes into account the properties of prediction-based optimization algorithms better than existing measures. It measures how fast an algorithm approaches the global optimum relative to the worst one.

A detailed description of RCS can be found in [1] or in this [document](https://github.com/almuthmeier/RCS/blob/github/documentation.pdf).

## Requirements & Installation
In order to run this python project you need a python installation and numpy. The code has been tested with:  
    - Python 3.5.2  
    - Ubuntu 16.04  

## Usage
Run the main function in rcs.py; it implements a small example.
